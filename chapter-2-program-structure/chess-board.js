/**
* @name createChessBoard
* @description Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid,
  using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid
  there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

  Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #

  When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8
  and change the program so that it works for any size,
  outputting a grid of the given width and height.
